## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

No necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python and DataSpell IDE.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb data from 2023 to better understand:

1. What features can strongly affect Airbnb rental price?
2. What features distinguishes Airbnb homes in Seattle from those in Boston?
3. How to differentiate the reviews based on price?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is only one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used for code clarification.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@avahsomto042/in-depth-analysis-of-seattle-and-boston-airbnb-data-200f7ea28c8e).
