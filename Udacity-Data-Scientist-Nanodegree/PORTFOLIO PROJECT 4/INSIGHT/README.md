## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is only one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used for code clarification.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@avahsomto042/unveiling-the-crystal-ball-predicting-churn-rate-for-sparkify-the-ultimate-music-streaming-cfe7434967b)
