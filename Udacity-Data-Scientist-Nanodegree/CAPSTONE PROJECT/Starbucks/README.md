## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink 
or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks

For this project, I was interestested in looking at customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. My focus was on

1. Which demographic groups respond best to which offer type?
2. How best can we present each type of offer to all its users?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is only one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. 
The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. 
Markdown cells were used for code clarification.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

I was able to analyze the users interactions with the articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Thanks to Starbucks for the data. Thanks to Udacity for the workspace provided.
