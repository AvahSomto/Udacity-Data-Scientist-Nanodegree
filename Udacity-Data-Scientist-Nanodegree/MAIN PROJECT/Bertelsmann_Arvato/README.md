The libaries used for this project is python 3.7 and above, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, math and 
the platform was Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in looking at how can a mail-order sales company in Germany acquire new customers/clients 
more efficiently

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is only one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebook is exploratory in 
searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  
Markdown cells were used for code clarification.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

I was able to analyze the general population and sample population and discovered customers that should be sent email campaigns 
instead of sending out email campaigns to the whole german population.
