## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The libaries used for this project is python 3.7 and above, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, pickle, re, nltk, sklearn and the platform was Jupyter Notebook.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in looking at the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform

1. How many articles does a user read when logged on IBM Watson Studio platform?
2. How to use ranke-based recommendation to find the most read articles by users?
3. How to apply User-based collaborative filtering to filter out users with similar articles of interests?
4. How to apply content based filtering to perform a ranking of the highest ranked articles?
5. How to build and use matrix factorization to make article recommendations to the users on the IBM Watson Studio platform

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is only one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used for code clarification.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

I was able to analyze the users interactions with the articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Thanks to IBM for the data. Thanks to Udacity for the workspace provided.
